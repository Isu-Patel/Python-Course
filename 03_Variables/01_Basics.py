# In python, variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout the program. A variable is created the moment you assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=).

age = 14 # Integer
name = "Isu" # String
cgpa = 4.55 # Float

# Rules of defining a variable in Python
# Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_)
# They can contain letters, numbers (0 - 9), and underscores(_)
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age and Age are different variables)
# Avoid using Python keywords (e.g., if, for, while, etc.) as variable names.

# 34age = 4 # Invalid because variable name cannot start with a number
age = 32 # Valid because variable can start with a number
# a$$ge = 45 # Invalid because variable name cannot contain special characters other than underscore
__age = 34
__nice_45 = 34
a_b_c_7 = "Sam"
